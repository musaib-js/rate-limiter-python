# Steps to setup the project

Since the project is dockerized, it is setup using docker, so running the following two commands can be used to start the project on a local system.


```docker compose build```

```docker compose up -d```

<strong>It can also be run without docker. Only the redis host needs to be changed in the redis_connection.py file.</strong>
